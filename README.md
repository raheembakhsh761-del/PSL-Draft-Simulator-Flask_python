# PSL Draft Simulator 🏏

A Flask-based PSL Draft Simulation System that allows teams to pick players under realistic PSL-style constraints such as budget limits, player categories, foreign player limits, and snake draft rounds.

This project is developed for **educational and academic purposes** and demonstrates the use of **Data Structures, File Handling, and Flask Web Development**.
